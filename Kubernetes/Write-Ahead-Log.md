- 🛡️ **Write-Ahead Log (WAL) to the Rescue**: Protects your progress even if your device crashes.
    
- 📝💾 **How it Works**: WAL logs your achievements locally before updating the main database, ensuring no data loss.
    
- 🚀 **Why it Matters**: Writing logs is faster than transferring data to a distant server, making WAL your hero in saving progress.
    
- 🌐 **Fun Fact**: This strategy is also utilized by Kubernetes "etcd".
