TCP is reliable protocol and connection oriented protocol 

UDP is not reliable protocol and connection lesys protocol

both are bidirectional

TCP is reliable as it use its ackknowledgement number and other mechanism to reliable transmit data to devices and thats why it is slow

UDP does not have such mechanism so it is fast also it does not have congestiion control.
