In the context of Language Learning Models (LLMs), “weights” are a type of parameter that the model uses to make decisions. You can think of weights as the importance or influence that one piece of information has on another.

Let’s use an analogy to make this clearer. Imagine you’re in a group project at school. Each member of the group has a different “weight” or influence on the final project. Some members might contribute a lot and have a high weight, while others might not contribute as much and have a lower weight.

In an LLM, each input (like a word in a sentence) is associated with a weight. The model learns these weights during training. If a word has a high weight, it means that the word is very influential in determining the output of the model. If a word has a low weight, it’s less influential.

Here’s a more technical explanation: In an LLM, weights are numerical values that determine how much each input feature (like a word or a part of a word) contributes to the model’s prediction. During training, the model adjusts these weights based on the error of its predictions. This process is often called “learning” the weights.
