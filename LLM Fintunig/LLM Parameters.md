- Imagine you’re trying to learn how to play a video game. At first, you might not know which buttons make your character jump or run. But as you play more, you learn these controls. In this analogy, your brain is adjusting its “parameters” to understand the game better.
- In an LLM, parameters work in a similar way. They start off not knowing much about language. But as they “see” more examples of sentences and words, they adjust their parameters to understand and predict language better.

1. **What Are They?**:
    
    - LLM parameters define how an AI model behaves.
    - They’re like settings that the model learns during training.
    - Parameters shape how the AI processes input and generates output.
2. **Impact**:
    
    - More parameters = more complexity and adaptability.
    - But there’s a trade-off: too many can lead to overfitting.
    - Think of it as tuning a musical instrument—finding the right balance! 🎵

Remember, LLM parameters are the secret sauce that makes AI models understand language!
